# Why Resistance Training?

You may have noticed by now that I talk a fair bit about how we should include some form of resistance training in our workouts.

Now it’s important to note that when I say resistance training, I don’t mean throwing around massive weights or becoming professional bodybuilders.

Resistance training also includes things like kettlebell work, callisthenics, bodyweight work and even things like some yoga and pilates.

Resistance training is important because it provides numerous benefits that typical cardio does not, such as:

- Improved muscle strength and tone, which protects your joints from injury
- Helps prevent age-related sarcopenia, which is one of the main causes of frailty, bone fractures, and reduced quality of life among older adults
- Weight management and increased muscle-to-fat ratio – as you gain muscle, your body burns more calories when at rest
- May help reduce or prevent cognitive decline in older people
- Prevention or control of chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, back pain, depression and obesity
- It helps with pain management
- Improved mobility and balance
- Improved posture
- Increased bone density and strength, which reduces the risk of osteoporosis
- It’s more fun (in my own personal, biased opinion)

And if you’re worried about getting bigger, then don’t. It takes years of work and the conscious decision to eat enough food to gain size!
