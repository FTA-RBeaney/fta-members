# Progressive Overload

The most important principle that we must follow with our training is the Principle of Progressive Overload.

Progressive Overload is simply the idea that over time we should increase the amount of work we do over time, primarily in the form of volume.

This is what forces our bodies to adapt and get stronger.

Volume = sets x reps x weight

ie. 3 sets x 10 reps x 10kg = A total volume lifted of 300kg.

We can progress by increasing either sets, reps or weight.

We can increase sets, reps or weight in order to achieve more volume over the weeks and months.

For example:

- We are given the rep range 6-10 reps for 3 sets for an exercise
- We decide to use 10kg for an exercise, thinking that it will be challenging for us to achieve the higher end of that rep range (10) for 3 sets
- The progression over the weeks may look something like this…
- Week 1 – 10, 9, 7 reps
- Week 2 – 10, 10, 8 reps
- Week 3 – 10, 10, 10 reps (next week increase the weight)
- Week 4 – We’re now using 12.5kg. Reps end up being: 9, 8, 6
- We now stick with this weight until we get 10, 10, 10 reps

This is called ‘Linear Progression’ and is a basic but effective way of making sure we get stronger and increase muscle mass (alongside appropriate nutrition).

Note: If you are completely new to the gym it may take a few weeks before you find weights that are appropriately challenging for each exercise. This is absolutely fine and a normal part of the process.
