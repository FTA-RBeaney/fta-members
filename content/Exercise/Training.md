# Training

I have one rule when it comes to exercise…

💡 Exercise is NEVER to be used as a punishment!

Your time working out should be used to build strength, build muscle and increase fitness.

We focus on resistance training, because there are numerous benefits that come with getting stronger. It also helps us to achieve that “toned” look that most people search for.

If fat loss is our goal, then exercise is not the way that we make it happen. Instead, we use our time outside of the gym to accomplish this via diet and activity.
