# Warming Up

Warming up is an important part of any exercise routine. When warmed up correctly, we reduce the risk of injury and improve performance and force output.

However, this doesn’t mean it has to be a long, laborious process that takes up most of your gym time. A warmup should take around 10-15 minutes max.

A warmup should:

1. Raise our body temperature
2. Increase our mobility
3. Prepare us for the specific work we are about to do

Here’s what this looks like on paper:

The pyramid warm up
After the above, for the first exercise of the day, pyramid the weight up to your working weight for the day. This is to practice the movement and get your body acclimated to higher loads.

For example, your first exercise is squats, and your first set is 100kg for 5 reps.

Your pyramid would look like this:

1. Bar x 10-15 reps
2. 40kg x 5 reps (40%)
3. 50kg x 4 reps (50%)
4. 60kg x 3 reps (60%)
5. 70-75kg x 2 reps (70-75%)
6. First working set

The video shows what this might look like.
