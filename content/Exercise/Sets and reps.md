# Sets And Reps

When we speak about resistance training, we hear the words ‘sets’ and ‘reps’ used quite a lot.

**Rep (Repetition)**

A rep is just a repetition of a movement through a given range of motion. For example, if you curl your arm up and then down, that would be 1 rep.

**Set**

When we perform a number of repetitions in a row, this is a set.

You may see a typical set up like below:

Squats:

3 sets of 10 reps or 3 x 10

This means: take a weight you can perform the exercise for, for around 10 repetitions before you feel like you can’t do any more.

Perform one set. Then rest for long enough to catch your breath. Depending on your goal and how challenging the set was, this could be anywhere from 1-5 minutes.

We want to make sure we’re adequately rested in between sets so that we can approach each one with a good amount of focus and intensity.

Then perform your second set!

Repeat this until you have completed all the sets, and then move onto the next exercise.

**A note about rep ranges…**

There is nothing magical about certain rep ranges. Some suit different styles of training better than others, but the important thing is the intensity at which we train, as opposed to a specific rep number, which we will discuss later.
