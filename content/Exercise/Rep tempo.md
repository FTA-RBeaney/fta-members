# Rep Tempo

One question that pops up is: “how quickly should I lift for best results?”

The short answer is that you don’t have to overthink it.

Rep speed is a very interesting variable we can play with, but not one you need to overthink.

The easiest way of thinking about it is this:

- On the concentric part of the lift (where the muscle contracts), do so with some ‘oomph’. We want to lift or pull the weight with a good amount of force. Ideally you should be lifting the weight with a solid explosive tempo (still under control) for maximum strength development.
- One the eccentric part (where the muscle lengthens) we want to control the weight down. This doesn’t have to be a precise number, but a 2-3 count is a good ballpark.

As long as you are lowering the weight under control, rep tempo doesn’t make a difference.

Again, this may change slightly depending on the exercise and the goal, but for most this is a good starting point to ensure we’re controlling the weight and getting the most out of the exercises.
