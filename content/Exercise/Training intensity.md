# Training Intensity

One of the most important parts of training is your training intensity.

Just moving your body is great, but if you want to get stronger and change your physique, then you need to make sure you're training hard enough so your body responds.

This video will give you a way of measuring whether you're training hard enough, and explain how we use the RPE scale to do so.

## RPE

RPE stands for ‘Rate of Perceived Effort’.

We tend to use this when explaining how hard a given set should feel.

Here’s a rough explanation of the scale:

- **10** — At your max, you have no more reps.
- **9** — There’s another rep in the tank, but it’s a grind.
- **8** — Around 2-3 reps short of failure
- **7** — Often, a weight one can move with power (5-7ish reps).
- **6** — Weight that one can move quickly for speed work (+/- 8 reps pending on speed/training goal).
- **5** — A weight that you might warm up with
- **4 & below** — Light weight that can be used for mobility, recovery, and form emphasis.

Most of the time we should aim for a 7-9, however there are occasions when we want to aim for a specific effort.

For example, occasionally it’s good to hit a 10 to really gauge where your limits are on exercises.

At the beginning, don’t worry too much about this. This becomes more important as you progress when balancing intensity and volume becomes more important.

## A note on failure…

You may here the term ‘to failure’ mentioned a few times.

There are 2 types of failure we can encounter when lifting weights:

1. Technical failure - this is where our form on an exercise starts to break down
2. Physical or absolute failure - this is where we cannot physically move the weight any more, no matter how hard we try

Generally, when we hit technical failure on a lift this is where we should stop, or a couple of reps shy of this.

On some exercises you won’t encounter this as the lift may not require as much technique (on machines and cable exercises for example).

In this case, you’ll probably experience physical failure. We also want to go close to this, maybe 1 or 2 reps shy.

Basically, when you go to move the weight and it starts to move slower because it’s more challenging, that’s when you’re probably close to failure.
