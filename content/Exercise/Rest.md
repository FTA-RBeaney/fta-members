# Rest

Rest is possibly the most overlooked aspect of training.

Unfortunately we have been sold the idea that training is all about "more more more" or that you have to be constantly panting to be working hard enough.

But with strength training, both the rest you take in between sets and your rest outside of training is important.

This is because rest allows our body to adapt to the stimulus we have placed on it in training.

### Rest Between Sets

Resting in between sets is important because we want to be able to put a good amount of effort into each set to create the response we want from our bodies.

Too little rest and youâ€™ll negatively affect the quality of your work in your next set, and too much rest means our sessions end up becoming really long.

Generally it's best to take as much rest as you feel you need and it depends on how hard a set was, but a good guideline is the following:

Big movements = 2-5 minutes

Smaller movements = 1-2 minutes

### Rest Outside of the Gym

Our bodies do not grow inside the gym.

Exercise is a stress that our bodies adapt to, and it is in rest where our bodies adapt and grow stronger.

**Stimulus (exercise) > Rest (recovery) > Adaptation (muscle growth, strength gain)**

Without adequate rest, our bodies will not recover and adapt properly, and this adaptation is what we want to achieve!

So what do we need to recover properly?

Well the key components are:

- Sleep
- Adequate protein intake
- Getting enough calories
- Reducing stress

Not all of these have to be perfect, but they can all contribute to how well we recover so it is a good idea to try and focus on them as much as possible if we want to optimise our results!

One final factor when it comes to rest is making sure we leave enough days between workouts.

The exact number will depend on our goal, training intensity and volume per session, but just be aware that having days off from the gym is not a bad thing!
