Daily and weekly activity levels are one of the most underrated parts of overall health — and one of the easiest ways to boost your energy expenditure if fat loss is your goal.

Here’s a graph showing how step count can reduce your risk of dying from all causes:

![Daily activity vs mortality](https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S2468-266700302-9/asset/63956204-c61a-4e4d-b787-2f606a12a84b/main.assets/gr3_lrg.jpg)

As you can see, just getting around 6,000 steps per day massively reduces the risk of all-cause mortality.

One important thing to keep in mind: that 6,000-step target is an average. If you miss it some days, that’s fine — you can make up for it with longer walks on the weekend or more movement during your downtime.

You'll eventually get a step target tailored to your goals and lifestyle, but it's a good idea to start thinking about ways to naturally increase your daily and weekly movement.

Also, consider grabbing a cheap step counter from Amazon. Phone trackers aren’t super reliable — if it’s not in your pocket, it won’t record your steps.

Now, you might be thinking: “Isn’t health all about exercise?”\:brNot exactly — exercise only takes up a small percentage of our week.\:brWhat we do the rest of the time? That matters too.

## Why daily activity matters so much

So, what counts as daily activity? It’s basically anything that gets you moving that *isn’t* planned exercise. Think:

- Walking
- Fidgeting
- Taking the stairs
- Hoovering
- Gardening

Now let’s break down some rough daily step levels:

- **Sedentary**: less than 5,000 steps
- **Low active**: 5,000 to 7,499
- **Somewhat active**: 7,500 to 9,999
- **Active**: 10,000+

These are just ballpark figures. Some people fidget a lot or have active jobs, so they might be moving more than the numbers suggest — but it gives us something to aim for.

So, why is daily activity such a big deal?

### **FOR HEALTH**

Long periods of inactivity increase your risk of chronic issues like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and even some cancers. Mentally, not moving enough is linked to low energy, poor sleep, higher stress, and anxiety.

Here are some stats:

- Adults who took **8,000+ steps a day** had a lower risk of death over the next 10 years than those who only hit 4,000.
- Compared to the 4,000-step crowd, people who got 8,000 steps had a **50% lower risk** of dying.
- Those who hit **12,000 steps**? A **65% lower risk**.

The wild part? It wasn’t about step intensity — just doing more steps each day made the difference.

And no, you *can’t* undo the effects of sitting all day with one gym session. Exercise doesn’t cancel out hours of being still.

## So, how many steps should I get?

Here’s a good guideline:

- **7,000 steps/day** (49,000/week) = baseline for health
- **10,000 steps/day** (70,000/week) = great for fat loss

You don’t need to hit that number every day either. It’s often better to think of it as a **weekly average** so you can fit movement around your schedule.

Example::brIf you walk 6,000/day on weekdays and go for longer walks on weekends, you could easily hit a 7,143 step/day average over the week.

## Why daily activity is key for fat loss

When it comes to fat loss, the goal is to create an energy deficit — in other words, burn more than you eat so your body taps into fat stores.

There are two ways to do this:

1. Eat fewer calories
2. Move more

The great part? You can mix and match based on what works for you.\:brDon’t want to cut your calories too low? Move more.\:brHappy to eat a bit less and add more veg? Do that.

We focus on **daily activity**, not just exercise, because exercise doesn’t actually burn as many calories as people think — it’s a tiny slice of your weekly energy use.

> *(Pro tip: don’t trust fitness trackers for calorie burn — they’re wildly inaccurate)*

Plus, more exercise often leads to more hunger, which can make fat loss harder.

Daily activity, on the other hand, is easier to work into your routine. You don’t need gym clothes or an hour to spare — just find small ways to move more through the day.

And here's a fun fact: the leaner we get, the more our bodies try to conserve energy. That means we *automatically* move less without realising it. That's part of why “starvation mode” feels real (it’s not, but your body *does* get sneaky about saving energy).

Tracking your steps helps fight that — it keeps you moving, even when your body would rather sit still and hoard fat.

## Tips to increase your daily activity

Alright, so how do you fit more movement into your day — without it taking over your life?

This is where tracking helps. You don’t need to obsess, but occasionally checking in is a super useful way to make sure you're not sliding into under-moving territory.

Phones are ok, but again — I recommend a cheap step counter or watch. More accurate, more consistent.

Easy ways to get more steps in:

- Park further away when driving
- Walk short distances instead of bussing
- Take the stairs or walk up the escalator
- Get off the bus one stop early
- Go for a short walk after lunch (also helps digestion)
- Set a timer if you work at a desk to get up and stretch

These are just some ideas. The goal is to **stay aware** of how much you’re moving and make small changes that add up over time.

You don’t need to be perfect — just consistent. Keep your activity up, and your body (and brain) will thank you.
